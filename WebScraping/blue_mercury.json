      "I have very long thick hair that is more a tighter wave than a curl. This spray really didn't work for me. It takes a TON of product to get my hair wet (so the cost/benefit analysis doesn't work out) and it ended up just looking like a damp frizz ball. I could see this working better on thin or short curly hair.", "I fell in love with this product when it was still called Bb Curl Pre-style Re-style Primer and was worried one day when I went to purchase more but couldn't find it. So I tried this Bb Curl Reactivator mist and was relieved and THRILLED that it's the same product with a new name. I have fine, thin curly/wavy/frizzy Caucasian hair and this is the only product that gives my hair definition (and I've tried them all)! I will never be without this product!!!",
      "Bought it. When I apply it to dry hair, it doesn't do anything. Hair is just as flyaway before applying as after. I was hoping to use this between washes, to revitalize it when I wake up in the morning, but no. The one benefit is my hair smells nice but that's an expensive way to get benefit", "I use Curl Reactivator to bring back life to my dry curls the day after washing. Just spray, crunch and go! Try it out yourself!", "Hair is really frizzy after using just once. I'll finish the bottle then never buy again. Never had the problem with other like products.", "I use all the curl care line- shampoo, conditioner, anti humidity gel, curl cream, mousse and love all these products but the curl reactivator leaves me dissatisfied. Initially, it does the job of improving my curls and making them look good. Later in the day/ next day it's like my hair is loaded with hairspray, dry and gooey. Only way to fix it is to wash it. Definitely not going to buy it again.", "I use it on my impossible thin curly hair that flattens while i sleep. Just spray on in morning and it is perfect and adds fullness to my hair. I have already bought extra just in case they discontinue it!", "So sad and disappointed that B&B has changed the ingredients to this. Why? The previous re-style/ prime spray perfectly fitted a gap in the market for those of us whose hair is neither straight nor curly. Much lighter than the usual curl creams and sprays this was perfect. The new version now contains cocoa butter ( many people are allergic to any cocoa related products, including me). Why mess with something that works? Arghhhhh", "I was scared because its a new formula. But definitely its better than the old version!!! Completely in love!!!!!!", "since trying to style my hair natural more often, I have been loving testing out products made for curly/ wavy hair. I was gifted these complimentary from bumble and bumble and I was so excited to try the reactivator because I've been looking for something to use on my hair day 2 or 3 to bring some of my waves back to life. Let me tell you- it does exactly that! It also smells amazingggg and I've actually started using it immediately after washing as a leave in conditioner and my waves look sooo good and bouncy whenever I use it. I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "Soo I recently dyed my hair. BUT, let me just help out my fellow curly girls really quick. This Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble trio really helped ease the process! The shampoo had amazing slip, the 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a leave in, Ofcourse I left it in.The reactivator came in clutch when my hair started drying too fast during detangling. Overall a 10/10.", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day. All the products has a nice mild fragrance which made my smell my hair every now and then. #Crueltyfree #Bbcurl #bumbleandbumble", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble and was extremely happy with the consistent branding and quality of the products. There was an instant difference in my hair quality and I love how this line has helped my hair", "I've always kept my haircare routine way simpler than my skincare -especially during our house reno and upcoming move. Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone. I feel like there's more definition and less frizziness when I use this product! Overall, a pleasant experience and I really enjoy the scent too!", "I received the new Bb. Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine. I've always loved Bumble and bumble products & this did not disappoint! I sprayed this into my hair until it was damp & diffused it right away, and it performed beautifully in my hair. It redefined my curls even better than they were on wash day! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replenish their curls past wash day!", "I use this product on 2-4 day hair. It works wonders and dampens my hair to revive my curls. Leaving them feeling hydrated and less frizzy. My curls have never been this bouncy after first day hair.", "I love the Curl Reactivator spray. Its seriously my all time favorite. I've applied it to my hair dry and wet and both ways leave my hair soft. It does not leave my hair stiff or flaky. Gifted by Bumble and Bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble & bumble to test & review. I've had Bumble & bumble products used on my hair during treatments before but have never purchased them before. I instantly fell in love with this product for my curls. It's so convenient being able to spray it into my hair or even just dampen day two hair and spray, my curls are instantly refreshed. The scent is light and fresh and I can smell it in my hair. The bottle is a very decent size so I know it will last me quite a while! My curls look much more defined when I use this, I love it!", "I was gifted by Bumble and Bumble, and YES, it is a match made in heaven. I usually use the invisible hair dressers oil to get my hair to look presentable on the daily and OH Girl to the office, but I like to wash and go when it's time to 9-5. and that's the way I like it. CURL REACTIVATOR is a game changer PERIOD. For all of the gals out there who discovered late how to get your curls in shape. 1) this is the magic you been looking for, and 2) GRRL your here now.:). Also the product makes my curls feel absolutely weightless, i'm jelous of how skinny my hair feels. XD. And REACTIVATOR is what beautiful smells like. My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo. Now the 3 in 1 conditioner, WOW period WOW, i wear it as a leave in/ curl definer and its 1000 x better than i thought it would be. MY curls BOUNCE back, not stretch out, BOUNCE back. ITS AMAZING. I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair. This spray smells really good but not overpowering. Doesn't make my hair feel sticky or crunchy once it's dry.", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me their Curl Reactivator along with their moisturizing shampoo and their 3-in-1 Conditioners ! My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration! Overall, I'd say 5 stars for @bumbleandbumble products they so kindly gifted me!", "Can we say hello to these beautiful curls!!! Luna is obsessed after trying @bumbleandbumble curl reactivator that was gifted to me by bumble and bumble. I was very impressed with how shiny it left her hair. It also left her hair smelling fresh and not sticky like other curl activators do. Hands down the best curl reactivator I've tried. Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair. It hydrates my hair while keeping it tame and not puffy. I've been using this for years and is a staple for my hair stash. I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "BB Curl gifted me. I have curly/wavy hair. Sometimes curly sometimes wavy. This product is amazing for my hair and I'm sure for yours too. It leaves my curls without frizz looking healthy and moisturized. I love how easy to apply is and also the smell is amazing. I'm so happy to have found this amazing line of products. Definitely will need to try more from the brand.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble.

I am extremely in love with this new formulation of butters and oils used in this product! I had used the previous formulation as well and loved it, but this one helps reduce frizz and hold the moisture in my curls for at least 3-4 hours longer. I have wavy to curly hair (3A/3B) and this product worked great on my otherwise full and dry hair.

You can use it one first second or third day hair and it still makes it look like you just washed it. There is no crunchy feel and it also smells amazing! I have never used a product like this.

This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft. Works great on its own and when used with the shampoo and conditioner. They're both awesome too. A little goes a long way and hydrate my hair without greasy feel or look. Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. 100% honest review though!", "I have curly/wavy hair and I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble.

I love that it adds moisture, some volume, and helps reduce my frizz.

( Gifted by Bumble and Bumble but opinions are all my own. )", "This smells AMAZING! I'm a huge scent person, so for me that is a big win. (It is strong though so if you are not a fan or sensitive for this, definitely consider that) I have dark brown hair (level 2/3) highlighted to a very light blonde (level 8/9). So that on top of being naturally curly (3a/2c) my hair is always super dry. Because of this I try to not wash it more than 1-2 times per week.

My hair is naturally curly but after bleaching/dying and daily use of hot tools it lost it's natural curls. This leave-in seems to be giving me back some waves without the crunchy effect, it even helped curl my ends some which I haven't been able to get my hair to do naturally in a while.

Shampoo: It has a rich consistency, with a milky color. The shampoo lathers quite well, love the soft flowery scent to it. . . . 3-in-1 conditioner: I used this to detangle in shower. It has a soft flowery scent to it. And it indeed detangled my hair rather fast. My curls looked defined even when they were wet. I used little bit of conditioner to style my hair as well after for leave in. . . . Reactivator: The reactivator has a spray nozzle, and sprays a generous amount of product. I used it the second and the third curl hair day. And it totally refreshed my curls, Also my frizz was visibly less. It was extremely easy to use and fast. The nozzle sprays out a generous amount of product, so it's easier to fix your curls, leaving your curls looking healthy and soft without it being crunchy. I have never been so satisfied with a product up until now. I genuinely loved using all the products.my curls have never felt this soft, bouncy and hydrated. They are amazing and I just loved them all. The best part is All the products are free from parabens, phthalates, mineral oils, sulfate cleansers, which is so amazing.", "This product was gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing purposes, and unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic! This does contain silicones towards the bottom of the ingredient list, so if you follow the curly girl method know that this isn't technically approved, but I would be comfortable using this if I was going to clarify soon.", "This curl activator smells delicious! Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl line and this product is already reviving my curls. My hair is so moisturized and SILKY, it's actually making it effortless for me to wear my hair curly.

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble along with the shampoo and conditioner. This is my first time using products from Bumble and Bumble and I am loving it. Firstly, the fragrance of all these products are amazing. I love it when my hair smells good throughout the day. It makes me feel fresh too.

I will continue using these for sure!", "I used this product in combination with the whole Bumble & Bumble line including the shampoo and the conditioner. I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life. It's not complete magic so I still clearly need a haircut to cut off frizzy split ends but it worked on the rest of my hair to add shine and definition without weighing it down.

It hydrated my hair a ton, which is great since I have dry hair! Overall, I really recommend this product!", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me their Bb. Curl Reactivator in exchange for an honest review. My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair! My hair is super thick and it kept my curls looking beautiful and soft! It smells amazing and gave me hope in beautiful curly hair!

It also keeps the frizz away! I love this line so much! Highly recommend!", "I have thick naturally curly hair with a medium curl. Something was missing from my curl maintenance products. I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold. To revive my curls on Day 2 and beyond I would rewet my hair and scrunch the curls. I needed a moisturizing styling mist to better reactivate my curls of Day 2 and beyond.

It could be love.", "my curls have never looked so beautiful! i have tried all kinds of products and i have always been disappointed with other products, whether they dried my hair out, didn't hold my curl , smelled too perfumey or weighed my hair down.

The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day.

Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes.

This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1.

And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them.

If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair. It hydrates my hair while keeping it tame and not puffy. I've been using this for years and is a staple for my hair stash. I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "BB Curl gifted me. I have curly/wavy hair. Sometimes curly sometimes wavy. This product is amazing for my hair and I'm sure for yours too. It leaves my curls without frizz looking healthy and moisturized.

I had used the previous formulation as well and loved it, but this one helps reduce frizz and hold the moisture in my curls for at least 3-4 hours longer.

You can use it one first second or third day hair and it still makes it look like you just washed it. There is no crunchy feel and it also smells amazing! I have never used a product like this.

This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft.

It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic!

My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling.

The previous re-style/ prime spray perfectly fitted a gap in the market for those of us whose hair is neither straight nor curly. Much lighter than the usual curl creams and sprays this was perfect. The new version now contains cocoa butter ( many people are allergic to any cocoa related products, including me). Why mess with something that works? Arghhhhh", "I was scared because its a new formula. But definitely its better than the old version!!! Completely in love!!!!!!", "Soo I recently dyed my hair. BUT, let me just help out my fellow curly girls really quick. This Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble trio really helped ease the process!

Overall a 10/10.", "since trying to style my hair natural more often, I have been loving testing out products made for curly/ wavy hair. I was gifted these complimentary from bumble and bumble and I was so excited to try the reactivator because I've been looking for something to use on my hair day 2 or 3 to bring some of my waves back to life. Let me tell you- it does exactly that! It also smells amazingggg and I've actually started using it immediately after washing as a leave in conditioner and my waves look sooo good and bouncy whenever I use it. I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day. All the products has a nice mild fragrance which made my smell my hair every now and then. #Crueltyfree #Bbcurl #bumbleandbumble", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble and was extremely happy with the consistent branding and quality of the products.

Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters .

Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone. I feel like there's more definition and less frizziness when I use this product! Overall, a pleasant experience and I really enjoy the scent too!", "I received the new Bb. Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine.

My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo.

I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair.

My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration!

Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down.

It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls.

I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft!

Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase.

I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in.

As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy.

My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight.

I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold.

I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day. All the products has a nice mild fragrance which made my smell my hair every now and then. #Crueltyfree #Bbcurl #bumbleandbumble", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble and was extremely happy with the consistent branding and quality of the products.

Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone.

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine. I've always loved Bumble and bumble products & this did not disappoint! I sprayed this into my hair until it was damp & diffused it right away, and it performed beautifully in my hair. It redefined my curls even better than they were on wash day! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replenish their curls past wash day!", "I use this product on 2-4 day hair. It works wonders and dampens my hair to revive my curls. Leaving them feeling hydrated and less frizzy. My curls have never been this bouncy after first day hair.", "I love the Curl Reactivator spray. Its seriously my all time favorite.

I've had Bumble & bumble products used on my hair during treatments before but have never purchased them before. I instantly fell in love with this product for my curls. It's so convenient being able to spray it into my hair or even just dampen day two hair and spray, my curls are instantly refreshed. The scent is light and fresh and I can smell it in my hair. The bottle is a very decent size so I know it will last me quite a while! My curls look much more defined when I use this, I love it!", "I was gifted by Bumble and Bumble, and YES, it is a match made in heaven. I usually use the invisible hair dressers oil to get my hair to look presentable on the daily and OH Girl to the office, but I like to wash and go when it's time to 9-5. and that's the way I like it. CURL REACTIVATOR is a game changer PERIOD. For all of the gals out there who discovered late how to get your curls in shape. 1) this is the magic you been looking for, and 2) GRRL your here now.:). Also the product makes my curls feel absolutely weightless, i'm jelous of how skinny my hair feels. XD. And REACTIVATOR is what beautiful smells like. My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo. Now the 3 in 1 conditioner, WOW period WOW, i wear it as a leave in/ curl definer and its 1000 x better than i thought it would be. MY curls BOUNCE back, not stretch out, BOUNCE back. ITS AMAZING. I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair. This spray smells really good but not overpowering. Doesn't make my hair feel sticky or crunchy once it's dry.", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me their Curl Reactivator along with their moisturizing shampoo and their 3-in-1 Conditioners ! My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration! Overall, I'd say 5 stars for @bumbleandbumble products they so kindly gifted me!", "Can we say hello to these beautiful curls!!! Luna is obsessed after trying @bumbleandbumble curl reactivator that was gifted to me by bumble and bumble. I was very impressed with how shiny it left her hair. It also left her hair smelling fresh and not sticky like other curl activators do. Hands down the best curl reactivator I've tried. Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle.

As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts!

Gracias!", "I use the Curl Reactivator on my wavy/curly hair and it does a really awesome job at refreshing my second day hair and enhancing my curls. I spray on to dry hair, then scrunch. I love that it adds moisture, some volume, and helps reduce my frizz. I noticed that after day 3 this starts to make my hair feel a little heavy, however, I do have fine hair so I'm not too surprised. But my curls still look amazing! I'm really loving this! ( Gifted by Bumble and Bumble but opinions are all my own. )", "This smells AMAZING! I'm a huge scent person, so for me that is a big win. (It is strong though so if you are not a fan or sensitive for this, definitely consider that) I have dark brown hair (level 2/3) highlighted to a very light blonde (level 8/9). So that on top of being naturally curly (3a/2c) my hair is always super dry. Because of this I try to not wash it more than 1-2 times per week. When I leave it curly this helps to freshen up my curls and add a bit more moisture. Complimentary from Bumble & Bumble!", "I must say my hair is loving this! My hair is naturally curly but after bleaching/dying and daily use of hot tools it lost it's natural curls. This leave-in seems to be giving me back some waves without the crunchy effect, it even helped curl my ends some which I haven't been able to get my hair to do naturally in a while. Love the ingredients and the smell is incredible! I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble and I definitely would recommend it !!", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me. I was getting the reactivator and to my surprise I got the whole collection thank you so much @bumbleandbumble this was a amazing surprise. . . . Shampoo: It has a rich consistency, with a milky color. The shampoo lathers quite well, love the soft flowery scent to it. . . . 3-in-1 conditioner: I used this to detangle in shower. It has a soft flowery scent to it. And it indeed detangled my hair rather fast. My curls looked defined even when they were wet. I used little bit of conditioner to style my hair as well after for leave in. . . . Reactivator: The reactivator has a spray nozzle, and sprays a generous amount of product. I used it the second and the third curl hair day. And it totally refreshed my curls, Also my frizz was visibly less. It was extremely easy to use and fast. The nozzle sprays out a generous amount of product, so it's easier to fix your curls, leaving your curls looking healthy and soft without it being crunchy. I have never been so satisfied with a product up until now. I genuinely loved using all the products.my curls have never felt this soft, bouncy and hydrated. They are amazing and I just loved them all. The best part is All the products are free from parabens, phthalates, mineral oils, sulfate cleansers, which is so amazing.", "This product was gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing purposes, and unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic! This does contain silicones towards the bottom of the ingredient list, so if you follow the curly girl method know that this isn't technically approved, but I would be comfortable using this if I was going to clarify soon.", "This curl activator smells delicious! Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl line and this product is already reviving my curls. My hair is so moisturized and SILKY, it's actually making it effortless for me to wear my hair curly. No frizz and lots of volume! I'm a fan!!", "I have very fine curly hair and I was worried this would be too heavy for my hair but it's worked wonderfully! I know its meant for 2nd and 3rd day curls but it has worked well even for right after shower hair. Also I like the stray bottle style, easy to spray through and spread easily. Only needed a few sprays to work and fix my curls! So helpful for frizz and control! This product was gifted by bumble and bumble but opinions are my own.", "My new go-to product for my curls! Bumble and bumble gifted me this Reactivator spray which is slowly but surely bringing my curls back to life.

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble along with the shampoo and conditioner. This is my first time using products from Bumble and Bumble and I am loving it. Firstly, the fragrance of all these products are amazing. I love it when my hair smells good throughout the day. It makes me feel fresh too. I have wavy/lightly curly, dry hair and this set provides good amount of hydration. Also, my hair looks healthy after using it. All this with only one wash!! I will continue using these for sure!", "I used this product in combination with the whole Bumble & Bumble line including the shampoo and the conditioner. I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life. It's not complete magic so I still clearly need a haircut to cut off frizzy split ends but it worked on the rest of my hair to add shine and definition without weighing it down. My hair wasn't left oily or sticky and smelled amazing! Disclaimer: I received these products gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing and honest feedback.", "This product was gifted by bumble and bumble. I love this product!

I love how lightweight it feels on my hair and the beautiful frizz free curls.", "I have never tried any of bumble and bumbles hair products before so I wasn't sure what to expect! The shampoo washed my oily and dandruff scalp really well, and the conditioner left my hair super soft! I have frizzy wavy hair so the curl reactivator worked well enough! I received these products gifted by bumble and bumble but review is my all my own!", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me their Bb. Curl Reactivator in exchange for an honest review. My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair! My hair is super thick and it kept my curls looking beautiful and soft! It smells amazing and gave me hope in beautiful curly hair! Thank you to bumble and bumble for giving me this opportunity to try this product and send it to me as a gift to try Definitely will buy this from now on!", "I received this curl reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble for my honest review. I love using this as a detangler. I use the shampoo and conditioner from this curl line and after I towel dry my hair I mist this generously from the middle and ends of my hair. It smells amazing and detangles so well! My hair feels silky soft once it's dried and my curls are better than ever! They aren't crunchy at all but more springy if that makes sense. It also keeps the frizz away! I love this line so much! Highly recommend!", "I have thick naturally curly hair with a medium curl. Something was missing from my curl maintenance products. I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold. To revive my curls on Day 2 and beyond I would rewet my hair and scrunch the curls. I needed a moisturizing styling mist to better reactivate my curls of Day 2 and beyond. The Bb Curl Reactivator gives my curls the boost I was missing. It could be love.", "my curls have never looked so beautiful! i have tried all kinds of products and i have always been disappointed with other products, whether they dried my hair out, didn't hold my curl , smelled too perfumey or weighed my hair down. This product is light but has a great hold and doesnt leave your hair crunchy! finally, ive found a product that works and keeps the compliments coming!", "I have 4 different curl types in my hair and this reactivates them nicely on day 2 and beyond. I don't like the smell of this one though."]}}]}

In a nice pleasant way not overpowering.", "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not too strong.  Fills the air nicely.  Really rich scent.  Highly reccomend!!! I can't believe I'm discovering this for the first time.  Pricey but worth it", "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Best candle and best place to buy it. The sales associates are the friendliest and most knowledgeable around. Thanks, Bloomingdales, for the best shopping experience ever.", "Reminiscent of a bouquet of roses, currant leaves and berries, there's a reason why Baies reigns as the brand's most popular scent.

Relaxing and calming scent. My only wish is that it cost less! Otherwise I\u2019d fill my entire apartment with them.", "This is one of my favorite Diptyque candles, and I\u2019ve tried them all. It\u2019s long-lasting and the scent\u2019s not overwhelming, just subtly gorgeous. My friends always comment on how good it smells. The only downside is the price, but it\u2019s worth it to splurge once in awhile.", "This is one of my favorite Diptyque candles for sure.The scent is pleasant while not too overwhelming.If you are willing to spend a little more for a candle I would definitely recommend this product.", "This is more on the sweeter side among all Diptyque candles that I own. Good scents but my husband doesn\u2019t like it because of the sweetness. Burns really well just like any other Diqtique candles and I\u2019d recommend this to somebody who likes a sweet scent that is not overly fruity but has an elegant mixture of fruitiness and florals.", "It smells sooooooo oooooooooohhhhh good and it pains me that it's so expensive because I'd have this on every night otherwise.", "There isn\u2019t anyone on this planet who wouldn\u2019t love this candle. That\u2019s why they make such great gifts (for others, or yourself). I\u2019m not even really a candle person. They are expensive but also miles better than anything else.", "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I would have to say the Diptyque Baies Mini Candle is only OK.  This was a blind purchase. I wasn't sure what I would receive but had I smelled this prior to purchasing, I don't think I would have settled on this scent.  I was hoping for more of a berry smell, but to me this smells more like my Grandmothers house in the sense that it smells like dusty roses.  Perhaps I've purchased this candle in the wrong season; spring may be a better time to light this. \r\n\r\nHowever, with all that being said, as a candle I have to say it is spectacular.  I live in a studio type apartment and this mini candle certainly gets around the place.  The scent is soft and not overwhelming so I don't mind that my home smells faintly of roses. Also, when I put the flame out; the scent doesn't transform into some gruesome odor as many other popular brands do, which is a huge plus for me and future Diptyque purchases.  \r\n\r\nI do recommend smelling before buying but if you're like me and make blind purchases then honestly this isn't a bad one to make.", "Perfect gift! My friend loved it. \r\n\r\nIt arrived very quickly.\r\n\r\nWill be my go to \"no gifts please\" gift.", "I got this candle several months ago at the suggestion of a friend who was burning in her home. Due to the high price I burn it sparingly so I enjoy it for a while but it is quite costly. The fragrance is fabulous and relaxing and makes the room(s) smell absolutely fresh and wonderful. Many compliments!  Getting ready to order 3 more. 2 for me and 1 for a gift.", "I adore this candle. It is pricy, but the scent lingers and it only takes a short time for it to do so. I have repurchased a couple of times and it is by far my favorite. For folks with very sensitive noses, this candle might be too strong. I think it's funny that the earlier reviewer hated this because it is too strong, but loved the fig candle. I, personally, could not smell the fig candle at all, so I guess she's correct that this is a much stronger candle. I love it! It's just so unique and makes a perfect gift.", "Lovely candle! The scent fills the whole room. Smells mostly like roses, but very nice!", "Love the smell and the long burn time on these candles.  I have a few of them and this is by far my favorite scent.", "I started with 1 Baies scented candle and now I have one in each room!  These smell so good and last a while.  I will definitely replace them when I finish them!", "This is one of my favorite candles from Diptyque. The smell is just beautiful!", "I was excited to receive this candle due to how popular this specific scent is. I had not originally smelled it in store, and just decided to purchase on a whim. Not the greatest idea. I really did not like the smell, and ultimately exchanged it in store for Diptyque's fig scent. The Baies candle has a strong smell, so I would encourage shoppers to smell it in store before purchasing.", "I ordered two Diptyque candles on a whim, basically because I kept seeing them on Interior Design blogs. Anyhow, I ordered Baies and Figuier, basically because they just seemed to be the most popular fragrances. I liked the Figuier, but Bies just smelled tart and was just a very difficult fragrance to be around for me. Of course fragrance is totally subjective, which I understand, but this one wasn't my fave. However, I would recommend Figuier and I plan to try some of the other scents.", "Diptyque candles are my go to gifts for housewarmings and birthdays - they are just so luxurious and you can't go wrong. The Baies, though I believe is supposed to be berries, is a clean, floral, rose smell that is incredible and is a perfect scent in the summer or winter. Because the large candles are so strong, I like these smaller sized ones for mixing scents and for lighting in smaller rooms.", "Baise by Diptyque is the best everyday smell. I've never received so many compliments on the smell of my apartment then when I have this burning. The life of this candle lasts much longer than other types, and the jars are great for a variety of things once the candle is gone!

The previous re-style/ prime spray perfectly fitted a gap in the market for those of us whose hair is neither straight nor curly. Much lighter than the usual curl creams and sprays this was perfect.

Let me tell you- it does exactly that! It also smells amazingggg and I've actually started using it immediately after washing as a leave in conditioner and my waves look sooo good and bouncy whenever I use it. I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day. All the products has a nice mild fragrance which made my smell my hair every now and then. #Crueltyfree #Bbcurl #bumbleandbumble", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble and was extremely happy with the consistent branding and quality of the products. There was an instant difference in my hair quality and I love how this line has helped my hair", "I've always kept my haircare routine way simpler than my skincare -especially during our house reno and upcoming move. Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone. I feel like there's more definition and less frizziness when I use this product! Overall, a pleasant experience and I really enjoy the scent too!", "I received the new Bb. Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine. I've always loved Bumble and bumble products & this did not disappoint! I sprayed this into my hair until it was damp & diffused it right away, and it performed beautifully in my hair. It redefined my curls even better than they were on wash day! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replenish their curls past wash day!", "I use this product on 2-4 day hair. It works wonders and dampens my hair to revive my curls. Leaving them feeling hydrated and less frizzy. My curls have never been this bouncy after first day hair.", "I love the Curl Reactivator spray. Its seriously my all time favorite. I've applied it to my hair dry and wet and both ways leave my hair soft. It does not leave my hair stiff or flaky. Gifted by Bumble and Bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble & bumble to test & review. I've had Bumble & bumble products used on my hair during treatments before but have never purchased them before. I instantly fell in love with this product for my curls. It's so convenient being able to spray it into my hair or even just dampen day two hair and spray, my curls are instantly refreshed. The scent is light and fresh and I can smell it in my hair. The bottle is a very decent size so I know it will last me quite a while! My curls look much more defined when I use this, I love it!", "I was gifted by Bumble and Bumble, and YES, it is a match made in heaven. I usually use the invisible hair dressers oil to get my hair to look presentable on the daily and OH Girl to the office, but I like to wash and go when it's time to 9-5. and that's the way I like it. CURL REACTIVATOR is a game changer PERIOD. For all of the gals out there who discovered late how to get your curls in shape. 1) this is the magic you been looking for, and 2) GRRL your here now.:). Also the product makes my curls feel absolutely weightless, i'm jelous of how skinny my hair feels. XD. And REACTIVATOR is what beautiful smells like. My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo. Now the 3 in 1 conditioner, WOW period WOW, i wear it as a leave in/ curl definer and its 1000 x better than i thought it would be. MY curls BOUNCE back, not stretch out, BOUNCE back. ITS AMAZING. I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair. This spray smells really good but not overpowering. Doesn't make my hair feel sticky or crunchy once it's dry.", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me their Curl Reactivator along with their moisturizing shampoo and their 3-in-1 Conditioners ! My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration! Overall, I'd say 5 stars for @bumbleandbumble products they so kindly gifted me!", "Can we say hello to these beautiful curls!!! Luna is obsessed after trying @bumbleandbumble curl reactivator that was gifted to me by bumble and bumble. I was very impressed with how shiny it left her hair. It also left her hair smelling fresh and not sticky like other curl activators do. Hands down the best curl reactivator I've tried. Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle.

As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts!

Gracias!", "I use the Curl Reactivator on my wavy/curly hair and it does a really awesome job at refreshing my second day hair and enhancing my curls. I spray on to dry hair, then scrunch. I love that it adds moisture, some volume, and helps reduce my frizz. I noticed that after day 3 this starts to make my hair feel a little heavy, however, I do have fine hair so I'm not too surprised. But my curls still look amazing! I'm really loving this! ( Gifted by Bumble and Bumble but opinions are all my own. )", "This smells AMAZING! I'm a huge scent person, so for me that is a big win. (It is strong though so if you are not a fan or sensitive for this, definitely consider that) I have dark brown hair (level 2/3) highlighted to a very light blonde (level 8/9). So that on top of being naturally curly (3a/2c) my hair is always super dry. Because of this I try to not wash it more than 1-2 times per week. When I leave it curly this helps to freshen up my curls and add a bit more moisture. Complimentary from Bumble & Bumble!", "I must say my hair is loving this! My hair is naturally curly but after bleaching/dying and daily use of hot tools it lost it's natural curls. This leave-in seems to be giving me back some waves without the crunchy effect, it even helped curl my ends some which I haven't been able to get my hair to do naturally in a while. Love the ingredients and the smell is incredible! I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble and I definitely would recommend it !!", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me. I was getting the reactivator and to my surprise I got the whole collection thank you so much @bumbleandbumble this was a amazing surprise. . . . Shampoo: It has a rich consistency, with a milky color. The shampoo lathers quite well, love the soft flowery scent to it. . . . 3-in-1 conditioner: I used this to detangle in shower. It has a soft flowery scent to it. And it indeed detangled my hair rather fast. My curls looked defined even when they were wet. I used little bit of conditioner to style my hair as well after for leave in. . . . Reactivator: The reactivator has a spray nozzle, and sprays a generous amount of product. I used it the second and the third curl hair day. And it totally refreshed my curls, Also my frizz was visibly less. It was extremely easy to use and fast. The nozzle sprays out a generous amount of product, so it's easier to fix your curls, leaving your curls looking healthy and soft without it being crunchy. I have never been so satisfied with a product up until now. I genuinely loved using all the products.my curls have never felt this soft, bouncy and hydrated. They are amazing and I just loved them all. The best part is All the products are free from parabens, phthalates, mineral oils, sulfate cleansers, which is so amazing.", "This product was gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing purposes, and unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic! This does contain silicones towards the bottom of the ingredient list, so if you follow the curly girl method know that this isn't technically approved, but I would be comfortable using this if I was going to clarify soon.", "This curl activator smells delicious! Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl line and this product is already reviving my curls. My hair is so moisturized and SILKY, it's actually making it effortless for me to wear my hair curly. No frizz and lots of volume! I'm a fan!!", "I have very fine curly hair and I was worried this would be too heavy for my hair but it's worked wonderfully! I know its meant for 2nd and 3rd day curls but it has worked well even for right after shower hair. Also I like the stray bottle style, easy to spray through and spread easily. Only needed a few sprays to work and fix my curls! So helpful for frizz and control! This product was gifted by bumble and bumble but opinions are my own.", "My new go-to product for my curls! Bumble and bumble gifted me this Reactivator spray which is slowly but surely bringing my curls back to life. If I feel they are losing their definition and shine, I just spritz this in, scrunch my curls and voila!

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble along with the shampoo and conditioner. This is my first time using products from Bumble and Bumble and I am loving it. Firstly, the fragrance of all these products are amazing. I love it when my hair smells good throughout the day. It makes me feel fresh too. I have wavy/lightly curly, dry hair and this set provides good amount of hydration. Also, my hair looks healthy after using it. All this with only one wash!! I will continue using these for sure!", "I used this product in combination with the whole Bumble & Bumble line including the shampoo and the conditioner. I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life. It's not complete magic so I still clearly need a haircut to cut off frizzy split ends but it worked on the rest of my hair to add shine and definition without weighing it down. My hair wasn't left oily or sticky and smelled amazing! Disclaimer: I received these products gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing and honest feedback.", "This product was gifted by bumble and bumble. I love this product! It made my hair so smooth, and defined! It hydrated my hair a ton, which is great since I have dry hair! Overall, I really recommend this product!", "The Bb curl reactivator was gifted to me from bumble and bumble. I love how my curls turned out after using this as a leave in conditioner. I also used it on my third day curls to reactivate them and they looked just as good as the first day. I love how lightweight it feels on my hair and the beautiful frizz free curls.", "I have never tried any of bumble and bumbles hair products before so I wasn't sure what to expect! The shampoo washed my oily and dandruff scalp really well, and the conditioner left my hair super soft! I have frizzy wavy hair so the curl reactivator worked well enough! I received these products gifted by bumble and bumble but review is my all my own!", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me their Bb. Curl Reactivator in exchange for an honest review. My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair! My hair is super thick and it kept my curls looking beautiful and soft! It smells amazing and gave me hope in beautiful curly hair! Thank you to bumble and bumble for giving me this opportunity to try this product and send it to me as a gift to try Definitely will buy this from now on!", "I received this curl reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble for my honest review. I love using this as a detangler. I use the shampoo and conditioner from this curl line and after I towel dry my hair I mist this generously from the middle and ends of my hair. It smells amazing and detangles so well! My hair feels silky soft once it's dried and my curls are better than ever! They aren't crunchy at all but more springy if that makes sense. It also keeps the frizz away! I love this line so much! Highly recommend!", "I have thick naturally curly hair with a medium curl. Something was missing from my curl maintenance products. I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold. To revive my curls on Day 2 and beyond I would rewet my hair and scrunch the curls. I needed a moisturizing styling mist to better reactivate my curls of Day 2 and beyond. The Bb Curl Reactivator gives my curls the boost I was missing. It could be love.", "my curls have never looked so beautiful! i have tried all kinds of products and i have always been disappointed with other products, whether they dried my hair out, didn't hold my curl , smelled too perfumey or weighed my hair down.

The previous re-style/ prime spray perfectly fitted a gap in the market for those of us whose hair is neither straight nor curly. Much lighter than the usual curl creams and sprays this was perfect.

Let me tell you- it does exactly that! It also smells amazingggg and I've actually started using it immediately after washing as a leave in conditioner and my waves look sooo good and bouncy whenever I use it. I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day.

Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone.

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine.

My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo. Now the 3 in 1 conditioner, WOW period WOW, i wear it as a leave in/ curl definer and its 1000 x better than i thought it would be. MY curls BOUNCE back, not stretch out, BOUNCE back. ITS AMAZING. I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair. This spray smells really good but not overpowering. Doesn't make my hair feel sticky or crunchy once it's dry.", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me their Curl Reactivator along with their moisturizing shampoo and their 3-in-1 Conditioners ! My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration!

Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down.

I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it!

I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair. It hydrates my hair while keeping it tame and not puffy. I've been using this for years and is a staple for my hair stash. I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have recently started a natural hair journey and have been looking for the best products to help me regain the shape of my curls! I love using the curl reactivator mid way through diffusing my hair. It gives so much shape without weighing my hair down or making it feel sticky or crunchy! The entire BB Curl line has honestly been so amazing to use on my hair and I will definitely be a repeat customer for these products!", "BB Curl gifted me. I have curly/wavy hair. Sometimes curly sometimes wavy. This product is amazing for my hair and I'm sure for yours too. It leaves my curls without frizz looking healthy and moisturized.

I am extremely in love with this new formulation of butters and oils used in this product! I had used the previous formulation as well and loved it, but this one helps reduce frizz and hold the moisture in my curls for at least 3-4 hours longer. I have wavy to curly hair (3A/3B) and this product worked great on my otherwise full and dry hair. I love the colors in the packaging too, and was super stoked to see that Bumble and Bumble kindly gifted me all the other products in this lineup as well! So kind.", "My hair texture can vary day to day but my favorite products remain the same. Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl reactivator and I am loving how easy it is to refresh my hair. You can use it one first second or third day hair and it still makes it look like you just washed it. There is no crunchy feel and it also smells amazing! I have never used a product like this. In fact to revive my curls I typically just get them wet again. This gives my hair body and better texture too.", "\u262e\ufe0e\ufe0e, , \u262e\ufe0e\ufe0e #giftedbybumbleandbumble . .

The aroma of this entire system is just lovely, a clean, fresh, salon smell. . . I highly recommend and cannot wait to trial more haircare from the Bb brand!", "Wow ! This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft. Works great on its own and when used with the shampoo and conditioner. They're both awesome too. A little goes a long way and hydrate my hair without greasy feel or look. Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. 100% honest review though!", "I have curly/wavy hair and I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble.

( Gifted by Bumble and Bumble but opinions are all my own. )", "This smells AMAZING! I'm a huge scent person, so for me that is a big win. (It is strong though so if you are not a fan or sensitive for this, definitely consider that) I have dark brown hair (level 2/3) highlighted to a very light blonde (level 8/9). So that on top of being naturally curly (3a/2c) my hair is always super dry. Because of this I try to not wash it more than 1-2 times per week.

It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic! This does contain silicones towards the bottom of the ingredient list, so if you follow the curly girl method know that this isn't technically approved, but I would be comfortable using this if I was going to clarify soon.", "This curl activator smells delicious!

I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life.

I received these products gifted by bumble and bumble but review is my all my own!", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me their Bb. Curl Reactivator in exchange for an honest review. My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair!

It also keeps the frizz away! I love this line so much! Highly recommend!", "I have thick naturally curly hair with a medium curl. Something was missing from my curl maintenance products. I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold. To revive my curls on Day 2 and beyond I would rewet my hair and scrunch the curls. I needed a moisturizing styling mist to better reactivate my curls of Day 2 and beyond. The Bb Curl Reactivator gives my curls the boost I was missing. It could be love.", "my curls have never looked so beautiful! i have tried all kinds of products and i have always been disappointed with other products, whether they dried my hair out, didn't hold my curl , smelled too perfumey or weighed my hair down.

It takes a TON of product to get my hair wet (so the cost/benefit analysis doesn't work out) and it ended up just looking like a damp frizz ball. I could see this working better on thin or short curly hair.", "I fell in love with this product when it was still called Bb Curl Pre-style Re-style Primer and was worried one day when I went to purchase more but couldn't find it. So I tried this Bb Curl Reactivator mist and was relieved and THRILLED that it's the same product with a new name. I have fine, thin curly/wavy/frizzy Caucasian hair and this is the only product that gives my hair definition (and I've tried them all)! I will never be without this product!!!", "Bought it. When I apply it to dry hair, it doesn't do anything. Hair is just as flyaway before applying as after. I was hoping to use this between washes, to revitalize it when I wake up in the morning, but no. The one benefit is my hair smells nice but that's an expensive way to get benefit", "I use Curl Reactivator to bring back life to my dry curls the day after washing. Just spray, crunch and go! Try it out yourself!", "Hair is really frizzy after using just once. I'll finish the bottle then never buy again. Never had the problem with other like products.", "I use all the curl care line- shampoo, conditioner, anti humidity gel, curl cream, mousse and love all these products but the curl reactivator leaves me dissatisfied. Initially, it does the job of improving my curls and making them look good. Later in the day/ next day it's like my hair is loaded with hairspray, dry and gooey. Only way to fix it is to wash it. Definitely not going to buy it again.", "I use it on my impossible thin curly hair that flattens while i sleep. Just spray on in morning and it is perfect and adds fullness to my hair. I have already bought extra just in case they discontinue it!", "So sad and disappointed that B&B has changed the ingredients to this. Why? The previous re-style/ prime spray perfectly fitted a gap in the market for those of us whose hair is neither straight nor curly. Much lighter than the usual curl creams and sprays this was perfect. The new version now contains cocoa butter ( many people are allergic to any cocoa related products, including me). Why mess with something that works? Arghhhhh", "I was scared because its a new formula. But definitely its better than the old version!!! Completely in love!!!!!!", "Soo I recently dyed my hair. BUT, let me just help out my fellow curly girls really quick. This Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble trio really helped ease the process! The shampoo had amazing slip, the 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a leave in, Ofcourse I left it in.The reactivator came in clutch when my hair started drying too fast during detangling. Overall a 10/10.", "since trying to style my hair natural more often, I have been loving testing out products made for curly/ wavy hair. I was gifted these complimentary from bumble and bumble and I was so excited to try the reactivator because I've been looking for something to use on my hair day 2 or 3 to bring some of my waves back to life. Let me tell you- it does exactly that! It also smells amazingggg and I've actually started using it immediately after washing as a leave in conditioner and my waves look sooo good and bouncy whenever I use it. I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day. All the products has a nice mild fragrance which made my smell my hair every now and then. #Crueltyfree #Bbcurl #bumbleandbumble", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble and was extremely happy with the consistent branding and quality of the products. There was an instant difference in my hair quality and I love how this line has helped my hair", "I've always kept my haircare routine way simpler than my skincare -especially during our house reno and upcoming move. Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone. I feel like there's more definition and less frizziness when I use this product! Overall, a pleasant experience and I really enjoy the scent too!", "I received the new Bb. Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine. I've always loved Bumble and bumble products & this did not disappoint! I sprayed this into my hair until it was damp & diffused it right away, and it performed beautifully in my hair. It redefined my curls even better than they were on wash day! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replenish their curls past wash day!", "I use this product on 2-4 day hair. It works wonders and dampens my hair to revive my curls. Leaving them feeling hydrated and less frizzy. My curls have never been this bouncy after first day hair.", "I love the Curl Reactivator spray. Its seriously my all time favorite. I've applied it to my hair dry and wet and both ways leave my hair soft. It does not leave my hair stiff or flaky. Gifted by Bumble and Bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble & bumble to test & review. I've had Bumble & bumble products used on my hair during treatments before but have never purchased them before. I instantly fell in love with this product for my curls. It's so convenient being able to spray it into my hair or even just dampen day two hair and spray, my curls are instantly refreshed. The scent is light and fresh and I can smell it in my hair. The bottle is a very decent size so I know it will last me quite a while! My curls look much more defined when I use this, I love it!", "I was gifted by Bumble and Bumble, and YES, it is a match made in heaven. I usually use the invisible hair dressers oil to get my hair to look presentable on the daily and OH Girl to the office, but I like to wash and go when it's time to 9-5. and that's the way I like it. CURL REACTIVATOR is a game changer PERIOD. For all of the gals out there who discovered late how to get your curls in shape. 1) this is the magic you been looking for, and 2) GRRL your here now.:). Also the product makes my curls feel absolutely weightless, i'm jelous of how skinny my hair feels. XD. And REACTIVATOR is what beautiful smells like. My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo. Now the 3 in 1 conditioner, WOW period WOW, i wear it as a leave in/ curl definer and its 1000 x better than i thought it would be. MY curls BOUNCE back, not stretch out, BOUNCE back. ITS AMAZING. I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair. This spray smells really good but not overpowering. Doesn't make my hair feel sticky or crunchy once it's dry.", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me their Curl Reactivator along with their moisturizing shampoo and their 3-in-1 Conditioners ! My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration! Overall, I'd say 5 stars for @bumbleandbumble products they so kindly gifted me!", "Can we say hello to these beautiful curls!!! Luna is obsessed after trying @bumbleandbumble curl reactivator that was gifted to me by bumble and bumble. I was very impressed with how shiny it left her hair. It also left her hair smelling fresh and not sticky like other curl activators do. Hands down the best curl reactivator I've tried. Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair.

I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have recently started a natural hair journey and have been looking for the best products to help me regain the shape of my curls!

I love my curls but sleeping on them is a bummer due to waking up with crushed curls the next morning, this spray have brought back shape and definition the morning after a good sleep and I'm able to quickly run out the door for a shift at work or running daily errands. . The aroma of this entire system is just lovely, a clean, fresh, salon smell. . . I highly recommend and cannot wait to trial more haircare from the Bb brand!", "Wow ! This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft. Works great on its own and when used with the shampoo and conditioner. They're both awesome too. A little goes a long way and hydrate my hair without greasy feel or look. Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. 100% honest review though!", "I have curly/wavy hair and I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I used this product as a daily refresher for my curls and this worked amazingly well - better than my usual cocktail of leave in and water in a spray bottle.

Gracias!", "I use the Curl Reactivator on my wavy/curly hair and it does a really awesome job at refreshing my second day hair and enhancing my curls. I spray on to dry hair, then scrunch. I love that it adds moisture, some volume, and helps reduce my frizz. I noticed that after day 3 this starts to make my hair feel a little heavy, however, I do have fine hair so I'm not too surprised. But my curls still look amazing! I'm really loving this! ( Gifted by Bumble and Bumble but opinions are all my own. )", "This smells AMAZING! I'm a huge scent person, so for me that is a big win. (It is strong though so if you are not a fan or sensitive for this, definitely consider that) I have dark brown hair (level 2/3) highlighted to a very light blonde (level 8/9). So that on top of being naturally curly (3a/2c) my hair is always super dry. Because of this I try to not wash it more than 1-2 times per week. When I leave it curly this helps to freshen up my curls and add a bit more moisture. Complimentary from Bumble & Bumble!", "I must say my hair is loving this! My hair is naturally curly but after bleaching/dying and daily use of hot tools it lost it's natural curls. This leave-in seems to be giving me back some waves without the crunchy effect, it even helped curl my ends some which I haven't been able to get my hair to do naturally in a while. Love the ingredients and the smell is incredible! I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble and I definitely would recommend it !!", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me. I was getting the reactivator and to my surprise I got the whole collection thank you so much @bumbleandbumble this was a amazing surprise. . . . Shampoo: It has a rich consistency, with a milky color. The shampoo lathers quite well, love the soft flowery scent to it. . . . 3-in-1 conditioner: I used this to detangle in shower. It has a soft flowery scent to it. And it indeed detangled my hair rather fast. My curls looked defined even when they were wet. I used little bit of conditioner to style my hair as well after for leave in. . . . Reactivator: The reactivator has a spray nozzle, and sprays a generous amount of product. I used it the second and the third curl hair day. And it totally refreshed my curls, Also my frizz was visibly less. It was extremely easy to use and fast. The nozzle sprays out a generous amount of product, so it's easier to fix your curls, leaving your curls looking healthy and soft without it being crunchy. I have never been so satisfied with a product up until now. I genuinely loved using all the products.my curls have never felt this soft, bouncy and hydrated. They are amazing and I just loved them all. The best part is All the products are free from parabens, phthalates, mineral oils, sulfate cleansers, which is so amazing.", "This product was gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing purposes, and unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic! This does contain silicones towards the bottom of the ingredient list, so if you follow the curly girl method know that this isn't technically approved, but I would be comfortable using this if I was going to clarify soon.", "This curl activator smells delicious! Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl line and this product is already reviving my curls. My hair is so moisturized and SILKY, it's actually making it effortless for me to wear my hair curly. No frizz and lots of volume! I'm a fan!!", "I have very fine curly hair and I was worried this would be too heavy for my hair but it's worked wonderfully! I know its meant for 2nd and 3rd day curls but it has worked well even for right after shower hair. Also I like the stray bottle style, easy to spray through and spread easily. Only needed a few sprays to work and fix my curls! So helpful for frizz and control! This product was gifted by bumble and bumble but opinions are my own.", "My new go-to product for my curls! Bumble and bumble gifted me this Reactivator spray which is slowly but surely bringing my curls back to life.

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble along with the shampoo and conditioner. This is my first time using products from Bumble and Bumble and I am loving it. Firstly, the fragrance of all these products are amazing. I love it when my hair smells good throughout the day. It makes me feel fresh too. I have wavy/lightly curly, dry hair and this set provides good amount of hydration. Also, my hair looks healthy after using it. All this with only one wash!! I will continue using these for sure!", "I used this product in combination with the whole Bumble & Bumble line including the shampoo and the conditioner. I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life. It's not complete magic so I still clearly need a haircut to cut off frizzy split ends but it worked on the rest of my hair to add shine and definition without weighing it down. My hair wasn't left oily or sticky and smelled amazing! Disclaimer: I received these products gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing and honest feedback.", "This product was gifted by bumble and bumble. I love this product!

I love how lightweight it feels on my hair and the beautiful frizz free curls.", "I have never tried any of bumble and bumbles hair products before so I wasn't sure what to expect! The shampoo washed my oily and dandruff scalp really well, and the conditioner left my hair super soft! I have frizzy wavy hair so the curl reactivator worked well enough! I received these products gifted by bumble and bumble but review is my all my own!", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me their Bb. Curl Reactivator in exchange for an honest review. My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair! My hair is super thick and it kept my curls looking beautiful and soft! It smells amazing and gave me hope in beautiful curly hair! Thank you to bumble and bumble for giving me this opportunity to try this product and send it to me as a gift to try Definitely will buy this from now on!", "I received this curl reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble for my honest review. I love using this as a detangler. I use the shampoo and conditioner from this curl line and after I towel dry my hair I mist this generously from the middle and ends of my hair. It smells amazing and detangles so well! My hair feels silky soft once it's dried and my curls are better than ever! They aren't crunchy at all but more springy if that makes sense. It also keeps the frizz away! I love this line so much! Highly recommend!", "I have thick naturally curly hair with a medium curl. Something was missing from my curl maintenance products. I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold. To revive my curls on Day 2 and beyond I would rewet my hair and scrunch the curls. I needed a moisturizing styling mist to better reactivate my curls of Day 2 and beyond. The Bb Curl Reactivator gives my curls the boost I was missing. It could be love.", "my curls have never looked so beautiful! i have tried all kinds of products and i have always been disappointed with other products, whether they dried my hair out, didn't hold my curl , smelled too perfumey or weighed my hair down.

While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant!

The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day.

Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1.

My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo.

I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair.

My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration!

It also left her hair smelling fresh and not sticky like other curl activators do. Hands down the best curl reactivator I've tried. Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair. It hydrates my hair while keeping it tame and not puffy. I've been using this for years and is a staple for my hair stash. I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have recently started a natural hair journey and have been looking for the best products to help me regain the shape of my curls!

You can use it one first second or third day hair and it still makes it look like you just washed it. There is no crunchy feel and it also smells amazing! I have never used a product like this.

This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft.

It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic!

My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling.

It look beautiful on Instagram too :)", "Diptyque candles are expensive but they are such high quality and so classy that I have purchased several.  Baies is one of the best sellers - a light berry rose scent.  It is not the fake raspberry super sweet smell that smells cheap.

Good scents but my husband doesn\u2019t like it because of the sweetness.

They are expensive but also miles better than anything else.", "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I would have to say the Diptyque Baies Mini Candle is only OK.  This was a blind purchase. I wasn't sure what I would receive but had I smelled this prior to purchasing, I don't think I would have settled on this scent.  I was hoping for more of a berry smell, but to me this smells more like my Grandmothers house in the sense that it smells like dusty roses.  Perhaps I've purchased this candle in the wrong season; spring may be a better time to light this. \r\n\r\nHowever, with all that being said, as a candle I have to say it is spectacular.  I live in a studio type apartment and this mini candle certainly gets around the place.  The scent is soft and not overwhelming so I don't mind that my home smells faintly of roses. Also, when I put the flame out; the scent doesn't transform into some gruesome odor as many other popular brands do, which is a huge plus for me and future Diptyque purchases.  \r\n\r\nI do recommend smelling before buying but if you're like me and make blind purchases then honestly this isn't a bad one to make.", "Perfect gift!

Due to the high price I burn it sparingly so I enjoy it for a while but it is quite costly. The fragrance is fabulous and relaxing and makes the room(s) smell absolutely fresh and wonderful. Many compliments!  Getting ready to order 3 more. 2 for me and 1 for a gift.", "I adore this candle. It is pricy, but the scent lingers and it only takes a short time for it to do so. I have repurchased a couple of times and it is by far my favorite. For folks with very sensitive noses, this candle might be too strong. I think it's funny that the earlier reviewer hated this because it is too strong, but loved the fig candle. I, personally, could not smell the fig candle at all, so I guess she's correct that this is a much stronger candle. I love it! It's just so unique and makes a perfect gift.", "Lovely candle! The scent fills the whole room. Smells mostly like roses, but very nice!", "Love the smell and the long burn time on these candles.  I have a few of them and this is by far my favorite scent.", "I started with 1 Baies scented candle and now I have one in each room!  These smell so good and last a while.  I will definitely replace them when I finish them!", "This is one of my favorite candles from Diptyque. The smell is just beautiful!", "I was excited to receive this candle due to how popular this specific scent is. I had not originally smelled it in store, and just decided to purchase on a whim. Not the greatest idea. I really did not like the smell, and ultimately exchanged it in store for Diptyque's fig scent. The Baies candle has a strong smell, so I would encourage shoppers to smell it in store before purchasing.", "I ordered two Diptyque candles on a whim, basically because I kept seeing them on Interior Design blogs. Anyhow, I ordered Baies and Figuier, basically because they just seemed to be the most popular fragrances. I liked the Figuier, but Bies just smelled tart and was just a very difficult fragrance to be around for me. Of course fragrance is totally subjective, which I understand, but this one wasn't my fave. However, I would recommend Figuier and I plan to try some of the other scents.", "Diptyque candles are my go to gifts for housewarmings and birthdays - they are just so luxurious and you can't go wrong. The Baies, though I believe is supposed to be berries, is a clean, floral, rose smell that is incredible and is a perfect scent in the summer or winter. Because the large candles are so strong, I like these smaller sized ones for mixing scents and for lighting in smaller rooms.", "Baise by Diptyque is the best everyday smell. I've never received so many compliments on the smell of my apartment then when I have this burning.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time.

It is so gentle and works for a wide range of skin issues. it brightens, improves overall texture, pore size, discoloration, and gives you glowing skin the next day!\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to use a peel without regretting it. I would itch and burn and it would take a month to get my skin balance back. This product has made me a believer in peels for sensitive skin!\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 Works wonders!", "The employees at your store on King St. did right by me and suggested a great product that I'll never stop using. Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone. I love the way it makes my skin feel and a lot of my friends have commented on how great my skin looks and asked what I am using.\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 I originally tried this product because I was given some samples and I immediately got hooked. Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it!

Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone.

Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser.

They really exfoliate and make me glow the next day!", "I never thought I could fall in love with a skin care product the way I have with Power Glow Peels. I'm on my third box now and simply can't get enough. I have red, sensitive, fair skin which tends to be more dry than oily. I started out using these peels 3 times/week. I gradually made my way up to 1/day but I feel like my skin gets too oily when I do that ( which blows my mind because typically, products like this dry my skin out even more). I love the tingly sensation I feel when I apply the pad. I usually fan my face with my hands afterwards. Immediately, Once the redness settles from the application ( a few minutes), my skin is bright and glowing. I use these at night every other day now. I don't apply anything afterwards other than eye cream because I feel the product works best that way when nothing else is penetrating my skin. I felt the power of this product immediately after using a sample that I received. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a few samples. I feel like BM always has them at the counter. You will be blown away too!", "I was given a few samples of this by a manager when I went in to buy eye cream. He raved about it and I was skeptical but man do they live up to the hype ! I have sensitive blackhead prone skin that has had a major 80% decrease within the first few weeks of using these.  They tingle a bit and give your skin a beautiful glow after washing.  I've been able to tell my pores shrank and I can wear less face makeup ! Definitely a necessity for those with clogged pores !!!", "I felt compelled to write this review simply because these pads WORK. The blackheads on my nose are gone, my pores are rapidly shrinking, and my skin tone is vastly improved. I also use them on the back of my arms and legs where I have...HAD...a few tiny stubborn bumps. It's so rare to find a product that gives these kind of results and even does so quickly. I recommend these pads to my friends who have all seen similar results. My only complaint is the products packaging. I would prefer if it was sold in a bottle, but that won't stop me from buying these anytime soon. If these were ever discontinued I don't know what I would do. Marla, please make these forever.", "My skin has been a wreck for while and I was desperate for something to help me get my clogged pores and dull skin under control. After only a few uses, I saw a HUGE reduction in break outs, pore size and (a huge concern for me) scarring, hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I also have unbelievably sensitive skin so I was very nervous about using a peel but these pads are incredibly gentle and I have no drying whatsoever. Truly a holy-grail beauty product, I don't think I'll be able to live without them.", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face.  I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.  For someone with dry skin, it would probably be too harsh to use everyday.  My face is clear and beautiful when I use these and as soon as I run out, my skin starts breaking out.  It is so obvious when I haven't been using these peels because my skin will completely change.  I am so glad I found these.  They are life changing!  I would recommend this product to all of my friends!", "I received a few samples and fell in love with this product! My skin is smooth and glowing. I use it every 2-3 days.", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin. These peels are amazing, gentle but you'll immediately notice brighter, clearer skin and minimized pores. I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydraboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one. I immediately went back to purchase more, and picked up a couple samples for my roommate, who has already purchased more. Life changing for your face. Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice  my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "My mom brought these back after a trip to a BlueMercury in San Francisco and was insistent that my sisters and I (18-24, combination-oily and acne prone) try them because she was so impressed. I tried mine that night and was absolutely amazed as well. The glow I wake up with in the morning is like nothing else and trust me, I've tried a lot :) Although they had generously given us a few wipes as samples, I decided it was worth it to buy the full box because I never want to be without these!", "I rarely RAVE over a product, but these peel pads have transformed my skin!! It has given my combo/breakout prone complexion clarity, smoothness, and a radiance that people actually compliment me on now!! It's such a staple in my regiment that I've turned all my friends and family on to. Anyone can use it. It's the easiest and most effective treatment I've ever used and am so HAPPY that these were recommended to me. I love Bluemercury, and the awesome skincare specialists that introduced me to such a fabulous product!!", "I unfortunately did not experience the same results as others with sensitive skin have found.  I'm very cautious and hesitant with anything I put on my face, but since this had high reviews for sensitive skin, I decided to give them a try.  They came highly recommended from my local Blue Mercury rep as well.  After my first use, I experienced extreme burning and prolonged redness.  I gave the product one more shot in case my skin just needed to adjust, but after trying again a few days later, I received the same intense results.  It appears to be good for some with sensitive skin, but beware it may not work for all!", "This peel comes as a small wipe in individual packets.  When you wipe it on your face, you'll feel tingling and a slight burning sensation.  Nothing too difficult to deal with.  I've never come across a more effective product (outside of going to a dermatologist) that gets rid of the dead, dry skin that I often deal with.  These are especially great when the weather gets colder and more dry...one swipe of this once or twice a week leaves my skin smooth and glowing.", "I invest in my skincare but continue to suffer from uneven, bumpy skin texture.  I started using this treatment daily and have noticed a huge difference within one week!  I can't believe the results!  I use it in the mornings after washing my face and apply a non-reactive lotion on top (no salcylic acid).  It is a little tingly and slightly itchy a few minutes after applying, but for me it's totally worth it.  I am seeing some of the best results I have ever seen from an at home skin care product.  So happy I found this!  Even my friends have noticed the difference, and went out to purchase!", "Got this as a sample when I bought some lip balm in a bluemercury in-store shop at Macy's. I am in my 40s & very particular about skin care and was a bit nervous to try this. Tingles a little going on, no overwhelming smell. Did not turn my face red but felt it working. My skin now feels firmer (in a good way) and smoother, and the tone looks great. I will be buying more of these. I think you could cut the pads in half and use them twice since they are very saturated. Big thumbs up for this product!", "I am in love! This is amazing. I feel like i have new skin.", "I received a few of these as samples as immediately went back in and bought the biggest box they sell! Love, love, love this product. I am almost 37 and fighting the aging process in a the most glowing way thanks to these! I have used several different exfoliators over the years and this is by far the best. Pricey but worth the money!", "I absolutely LOVE this peel. It's quick and easy! I notice a HUGE difference in my skin when using it! Breakouts disappear overnight, my face is bright and radiance too! I just wish it wasn't so expensive :( otherwise, i would buy it all the time. I only buy it when my skin is in need of it!", "I use these everyday after washing my face. I am able to use these everyday because my skin is oily.

I use it every 2-3 days.", "I used three of these peels over 6 days and i really did notice my skin looking clear tight even and pores were clean !", "I have fair, sensitive, breakout prone skin.

I follow with the M-61 C&E serum and hydroboost moisturizer at night and my skin is so fresh in the morning. I was given two as a sample, and noticed a difference after the first one.

Get a couple as a sample, you'll be back!!", "I love this exfoliating peel. It is so gentle and works for a wide range of skin issues. it brightens, improves overall texture, pore size, discoloration, and gives you glowing skin the next day!\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to use a peel without regretting it. I would itch and burn and it would take a month to get my skin balance back. This product has made me a believer in peels for sensitive skin!\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 Works wonders!", "The employees at your store on King St. did right by me and suggested a great product that I'll never stop using. Not only does it work, it works in ways that they don't tell you. I use the Power Cleanse, Power Glow Peel (2-3 times a week), Vitablast C hand cream and the new shaving cream. It all works. The power glow peel does wonders for my pores and it's so good that sometimes, I don't need a moisturizer after I use one. The Power Cleanse dried my face out the first time I used it but that didn't turn me away from the product, I continued to use it and my faced has adjusted and it works great!! The only bad thing about their products are the prices BUT my mom told me a long time ago, you get what you pay for! My wife has always appreciated the amount of time and effort I put into taking care of my skin, so to all of the men out there; use M61!!", "I tried a lot of peels where you need 2 - 3 steps, irritated my skin and caused over drying. This one is def the winner: one step easy application and awesome glow and plumbed skin after couple of applications!!!!", "I'm 22 years old and this is the only product (out of thousands) that I've noticed working in the first couple days of use. Most of my acne is hormonal/stress related, but I'm limited to the birth control types that do not contain estrogen due to migraines so unfortunately it does not help with my skin problems. Sometimes my skin is pretty clear aside from the small bumps on my forehead.. But then randomly I'll get bad break outs that I have a hard time getting control of (deep ones on cheeks, small painful ones around my mouth) and it's really frustrating. I love this peel because not only has it improved the acne I had when I started using, it has also prevented any new break outs. I use this peel a couple times a week paired with the cleanser and serum. I really love it!", "I used this product in combination with the M-61 Vitablast C serum to prep for my wedding. I had gone to the BM store in Fairfax and asked a Laura Mercier rep working there how to get rid of some dark spots that had formed on my face over the summer. She recommended (and raved about) the M-61 Power Glow Peel at night and M-61 Vitablast C serum for morning which was her daily routine. Her skin was flawless so I decided to give it a try. She was not employed by BM - and I say that to show she wasn't recommending this product line because it's made by BM - she was recommending it because it's amazing and very reasonably priced. After just over one week of using the products, my face was glowing. I would highly recommend this for anyone trying to even out skin tone and get rid of dark spots. I will never stop using these products!", "I went to a store looking for new foundation. The sales girl prepped my skin with one of peels and when I looked in the mirror I was in shock. One peel completely changed the look of my skin! I have tried every product on the market and this is the only one that has ever made my skin look so radiant and healthy. I left with the product and could not be happier with th continued results. Would highly recommend.", "The power glow peel gives amazing results. After only a few uses I saw results in the clarity of my skin. It tingles a bit when you apply it but it quickly goes away- trust me it works. I use these along with the power cleanse (which is also amazing for my oily skin). This is a product I plan to keep around for a while.", "I was hesitant to buy this peel because I've only ever used mechanical exfoliating treatments (such as the infamous apricot scrub). I went to BlueMercury for a facial for the first time last week and they used this peel and I noticed instantaneous results! I've had bumps on my neck and face for a while which were just dry skin and this cleared my skin up right away. I think the thing I liked the most was the fact that I noticed results right away and it doesn't dry my skin out like others do. It's amazing how exfoliating just one wipe can be!", "This is by far one of the most effective and worth every penny. I have break outs to my chin area and I used this last night, woke up in the morning, and the zits on my chin were not red and were less inflamed....I need a box of 60!!! Amazing and worth each cent! I would recommend to anyone!", "I had gotten some really bad cystic acne on my chin from using a toner. I was purchasing the face wash from the same brand and the sales associate gave me a couple of these as a sample. I was nervous to use it on my broken out chin, but did it anyway and am so glad I did!! Not only did my skin look awesome after using it, but my acnne spots were smaller and hurt so much less the next day! Going to be purchasing a box when I use my last sample for sure!", "goodness, my skin has never brokeout but since i used the acne cleanser by the same company then these m61 peels every 2days then use hydraskin moisturizer, within 2weeks allllllll my bumps were completely gone. i am a 24yr old black woman so after the bumps left. i had black scars.. ONLY because i was popping them before i got this skin regimen.. after that, i been seeing great results even my scars are lightening a little but thats when they offered bliss.. now bliss was very very watery that crap broke my face back out AGAIN!!! so now i need these peels to help vanish my bumps again... ugh goodness.. i was so back inlove with my skin until i used that bliss now it made bumps come back along my chin and lower cheek. i will most definitely be buying these.. this is the only thing worked for me!!!!", "I've been curious about the power peel for awhile so after talking with the girls at the St. Johns location I was sold on this and few other goodies. I must say it is a worthy buy. Even though I use one maybe once every other week the results the next day are mind blowing so I could just imagine what my skin would look like with daily use. My skin is glowing and smooth the next morning. Love it!", "I visited the store at Dupont Circle and they recommended this product. I wanted to \"shrink my pores\" and retexturize my skin (if thats even possible). Well...after two uses my skin was glowing like I've never seen. After 10 uses I simply can't believe the difference is so extreme, and so fast. It took care of things I never noticed until they were correct. My skin tone is now even. Any blemishes are gone. My pores are tiny. My skin reflects light appearing \"dewey\" or \"radiant\", and my wrinkles don't appear at all at \"resting face.\" GREAT PRODUCT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.", "Shakiba at Bluemercury Ann Arbor recently recommended this line to me. I was a little skeptical to try it, but LOVE the results! I started with the Hydraboost serum and eye cream, and recently returned to purchase the Power Glow Peel after using a sample. The combination has my skin looking fabulous. Highly recommend this line and will now listen to Shakiba!", "I first tried this as a sample when I was purchasing another item. I used it later that night and the results were instant. My skin never looked so bright, my pores vanished, and the next day, I swear my skin looked 5 years younger! I have used many, very expensive peels. None work as well as this one. Well done!", "Super easy - great for travel to keep your skin looking and feeling fresh.", "I have normal to oily skin and get the occasional breakout around my mouth/chin area. \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 This product has helped to clear my complexion and improve my skin tone. I love the way it makes my skin feel and a lot of my friends have commented on how great my skin looks and asked what I am using.\n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 I originally tried this product because I was given some samples and I immediately got hooked. Have repurchased several times now and will continue to do so.", "I picked this on a whim to be honest. In the past I have had plenty of bad reactions to peels being too strong but this dose the trick! If you have sensitive skin like mine expect a little redness and thats it! After a few days I could see major turn-over in my skin without the irritation! Finally found a peel I can use continually!", "Cleared my skin quickly but use sparingly because it will dry your skin out quickly. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the formula is packaged. It is frustrating how quickly you run out of them because they are rapped individually.", "This was recommended to me by staff at my local Bluemercury...and she said it would completely change my life. She was right! Has reduced breakouts and evened out my skin. I saw results after my second use. Now I am addicted! Definitely will be purchasing again", "This is an example of the body of a review. This can be up to 1500 characters long!", "I was introduced to this line while shopping at a new store location in Ann Arbor, MI. I had previously been using Glytone by Dermalogica but was interested in finding something that would do a better job at clearing my acne prone skin. The store associate put a sample of the Power Glow Peel in with my purchase of the m-61 cleanser and she said I would see visible results overnight. I used the product that evening and was shocked that in the morning my face already showed improvement. Went back to the store and purchased a box of 30. I have been using this product for 2 months now with such incredible improvement to my skin I was able to stop using all my prescription acne lotions and EVEN my oral medication. This product has changed my skin, diminished breakouts and dramatically healed the acne that was present when I started using the product. I feel so much happier when I look at my skin up close in the mirror now thanks to this line. I Love it!!", "I use this in conjunction with the Power Cleanse from M-61. Wonderful product line that I was introduced to when I was specifically looking for sulfate-free products for my combination/acne prone skin. I only use this about twice a week, and I literally cut out all of my other acne treatments and products because it works SO well. It reduced a cystic bump on my chin by 80% overnight! It left a prickly sensation on my skin after the first couple of treatments, though that was reduced with consistent use. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it is too expensive for a consistent purchase and my box had a missing treatment (though that was my fault for not checking pre-purchase). I wish they would make this in a bottle so I could use it more frequently as a toner!", "I use this in conjunction with M-61 power cleanse. I visited the store returning Mario Badescu's glycolic cleanser because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate which is a pore clogging, terrible ingredient. I was directed to this line and love the concept! I was given the sample for this peel, and went back to purchase the 10 treatment pack.When I got home, I realized the pack was missing 1 treatment which was irritating since it's not cheap. Overall, I love the product! It made a painful, cystic acne bump on my chin go down by 80% after one use! I have VERY sensitive skin and it's not too drying to use every other day. It is quite tingly, and feels almost like prickly needles for 2 minutes after applying. My main complaint is the price, and I feel as if I'm wasting treatment by the towelette packaging. Would love if you made this in a bottle, would be more resourceful and worth every penny!", "After being on countless over-the-counter and prescription regimens to help clear my acne, nothing seemed to be doing the trick. I have mild acne but also suffer from hyper pigmentation, so any acne I do get leaves a mark when it goes away! In desperation, I went to the ladies at Blue Mercury and they recommended this product. I've been using the peel pads for 3 weeks and not only is my skin glowing, but it has eliminated almost ALL my acne and faded the hyper pigmentation. I use the power cleanser before the peel pads every night, followed by a light moisturizer, and have never been happier with a skincare line! Being on a college budget, I am wary of shelling out so much money for skin care, but with these products from M-61, the money is well spent - I have recommend this peel and the line in general to all my friends! I will definitely be repurchasing.", "I tried a sample as I have sensitive skin and was amazed at the results in one day! I applied before bed, and when I woke up, my skin felt so soft and was clearer. I felt as if I just left the spa after a great facial. I will be buying in bulk!", "I'm learning to love this product line more and more. It's a great product line with effective and quality ingredients. I used to use this product when it was a 2-step process; this updated version is awesome... single step and added ingredients - that are good for your skin...I use a tretinoin cream on my face but rotate time off and have been using these instead with visible results. I'm not against spending money on quality skin care and cosmetics but these single packs are quite pricey, especially when using them every day. Perhaps a jar of them in the future to eliminate the individual packaging when not traveling? Aside from that - love them!", "I have never before reviewed a product, but I had to give a huge shout out for the m-61 Power Glow Peel because it ELIMINATED my hormonal acne (you know- that nasty, perimenopausal, monthly - like clockwork, congested chin kind). As I have sensitive skin, I followed the directions, easing in with use 2-3 times per week for a few weeks each night. Now I use every evening with sunscreen every day. Three months - no acne. None, nada. My skin is smoother, lines diminished. Seriously good stuff.", "The M-61 Power Glow Peel is the best thing I have ever used on my face! I used two applications several days a part. In the beginning I was very skeptical because I did peel like crazy and had minor itching from the skin flaking off. However after about 9 days my skin looked amazing! My 'marionette' lines around my mouth are almost gone. My face is so smooth! I haven't looked this good in 10 years. I am 54 years old and this product for me, has had the most dramatic results I have ever seen with any product I have ever used. If you can stand the process of the peeling then you will be amazed at the end results.", "I have congested skin that suffers from whiteheads and blackheads, and that also has a rough texture and large pores. This product, in conjunction with a few others that I found at Blue Mercury, has made my skin at 31 better than it has ever been. Despite dealing with mild rosacea, I am able to use this peel every night, after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. Not only has the congestion cleared up, but my skin is truly smooth to the touch, and it only took maybe two days or so for my skin to adjust to the product (I have basically no redness or irritation after using). \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 To be fair, I use this product in conjunction with several others from Blue Mercury, most notably the Cane + Austin Acne Treatment Pads in the morning, and the Tammy Fender Clarifying Dermagel immediately after the Power Glow Peel. I think it is the combination of these products that really makes a difference and I will be sure to review them as well."]}}]}
