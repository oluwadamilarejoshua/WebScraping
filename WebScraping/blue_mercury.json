      "I have very long thick hair that is more a tighter wave than a curl. This spray really didn't work for me. It takes a TON of product to get my hair wet (so the cost/benefit analysis doesn't work out) and it ended up just looking like a damp frizz ball. I could see this working better on thin or short curly hair.", "I fell in love with this product when it was still called Bb Curl Pre-style Re-style Primer and was worried one day when I went to purchase more but couldn't find it. So I tried this Bb Curl Reactivator mist and was relieved and THRILLED that it's the same product with a new name. I have fine, thin curly/wavy/frizzy Caucasian hair and this is the only product that gives my hair definition (and I've tried them all)! I will never be without this product!!!",
      "Bought it. When I apply it to dry hair, it doesn't do anything. Hair is just as flyaway before applying as after. I was hoping to use this between washes, to revitalize it when I wake up in the morning, but no. The one benefit is my hair smells nice but that's an expensive way to get benefit", "I use Curl Reactivator to bring back life to my dry curls the day after washing. Just spray, crunch and go! Try it out yourself!", "Hair is really frizzy after using just once. I'll finish the bottle then never buy again. Never had the problem with other like products.", "I use all the curl care line- shampoo, conditioner, anti humidity gel, curl cream, mousse and love all these products but the curl reactivator leaves me dissatisfied. Initially, it does the job of improving my curls and making them look good. Later in the day/ next day it's like my hair is loaded with hairspray, dry and gooey. Only way to fix it is to wash it. Definitely not going to buy it again.", "I use it on my impossible thin curly hair that flattens while i sleep. Just spray on in morning and it is perfect and adds fullness to my hair. I have already bought extra just in case they discontinue it!", "So sad and disappointed that B&B has changed the ingredients to this. Why? The previous re-style/ prime spray perfectly fitted a gap in the market for those of us whose hair is neither straight nor curly. Much lighter than the usual curl creams and sprays this was perfect. The new version now contains cocoa butter ( many people are allergic to any cocoa related products, including me). Why mess with something that works? Arghhhhh", "I was scared because its a new formula. But definitely its better than the old version!!! Completely in love!!!!!!", "since trying to style my hair natural more often, I have been loving testing out products made for curly/ wavy hair. I was gifted these complimentary from bumble and bumble and I was so excited to try the reactivator because I've been looking for something to use on my hair day 2 or 3 to bring some of my waves back to life. Let me tell you- it does exactly that! It also smells amazingggg and I've actually started using it immediately after washing as a leave in conditioner and my waves look sooo good and bouncy whenever I use it. I genuinely noticed a difference and gotta love that!", "Soo I recently dyed my hair. BUT, let me just help out my fellow curly girls really quick. This Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble trio really helped ease the process! The shampoo had amazing slip, the 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a leave in, Ofcourse I left it in.The reactivator came in clutch when my hair started drying too fast during detangling. Overall a 10/10.", "This was gifted by Bumble and Bumble. I had mixed feelings. While the product doesn't leave a stick or tacky residue, it wasn't as lastingly hydrating as I would have liked. Day 2 hair was intact but was very dry by day 3 aka wash day. The smell is sweet between amber and floral. Not my favorite but definitely pleasant! My curls definitely had a nice bounce to them and this product is perfect for styling on the same day as intended wear. But, for me requires another product like a dry oil to add some hydration.", "I used this product right out of the shower as well as on my second and third day hair!", "#complimentryfrombumbleandbumble So @bumbleandbumble gifted me their BB Curl Reactivator, Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 conditioner the other day. The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day. All the products has a nice mild fragrance which made my smell my hair every now and then. #Crueltyfree #Bbcurl #bumbleandbumble", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble and was extremely happy with the consistent branding and quality of the products. There was an instant difference in my hair quality and I love how this line has helped my hair", "I've always kept my haircare routine way simpler than my skincare -especially during our house reno and upcoming move. Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes. I've been applying it to the length of my hair and putting it in a high bun before bed and love the results. This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1. I can't wait to clarify my hair, reset it and incorporate this line again. I'm experiencing moisture overload right now, these are amazing products though. Highly recommend the 3-in-1 and the shampoo if your looking for frizz-free, soft curls", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble but all opinions are honest and my own. As far as curl activators, this is the first one that I've eve tried. I was surprised that it didn't make my curls crunchy or greasy and I would definitely say that this does a much better job of refueling my strands compared to water alone. I feel like there's more definition and less frizziness when I use this product! Overall, a pleasant experience and I really enjoy the scent too!", "I received the new Bb. Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and bumble. They also included their shampoo and conditioner which are long loved favourites of mine. I've always loved Bumble and bumble products & this did not disappoint! I sprayed this into my hair until it was damp & diffused it right away, and it performed beautifully in my hair. It redefined my curls even better than they were on wash day! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replenish their curls past wash day!", "I use this product on 2-4 day hair. It works wonders and dampens my hair to revive my curls. Leaving them feeling hydrated and less frizzy. My curls have never been this bouncy after first day hair.", "I love the Curl Reactivator spray. Its seriously my all time favorite. I've applied it to my hair dry and wet and both ways leave my hair soft. It does not leave my hair stiff or flaky. Gifted by Bumble and Bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble & bumble to test & review. I've had Bumble & bumble products used on my hair during treatments before but have never purchased them before. I instantly fell in love with this product for my curls. It's so convenient being able to spray it into my hair or even just dampen day two hair and spray, my curls are instantly refreshed. The scent is light and fresh and I can smell it in my hair. The bottle is a very decent size so I know it will last me quite a while! My curls look much more defined when I use this, I love it!", "I was gifted by Bumble and Bumble, and YES, it is a match made in heaven. I usually use the invisible hair dressers oil to get my hair to look presentable on the daily and OH Girl to the office, but I like to wash and go when it's time to 9-5. and that's the way I like it. CURL REACTIVATOR is a game changer PERIOD. For all of the gals out there who discovered late how to get your curls in shape. 1) this is the magic you been looking for, and 2) GRRL your here now.:). Also the product makes my curls feel absolutely weightless, i'm jelous of how skinny my hair feels. XD. And REACTIVATOR is what beautiful smells like. My husband will sit next to me on the couch and say ?YOUR HAIR SMELLS SOOO GOOD! its kind of hilarious... like did it stink before?!? idk let's cut him a break, but This is definitely everything i thought it would be and more. I also tried the CURL shampoo and it's more than a crush, I think i am getting back together with shampoo and I found the one. Sent is AMAZING, a little goes a long way and its an IDEAL shampoo. Now the 3 in 1 conditioner, WOW period WOW, i wear it as a leave in/ curl definer and its 1000 x better than i thought it would be. MY curls BOUNCE back, not stretch out, BOUNCE back. ITS AMAZING. I could use it as a leave in, a conditioner or, a co-wash. dare i say it but value. YAZZZZ", "I received this item for complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. I have naturally wavy/curly hair. I have used this a couple times to refresh next day. I first tried it on completely dry hair and it didn't look that great. I next tried it on slightly dampened hair (just water) and it worked much better + needed less product. My waves were revived a bit! I need to keep playing around with the dampness level in my hair. This spray smells really good but not overpowering. Doesn't make my hair feel sticky or crunchy once it's dry.", "@bumbleandbumble gifted me their Curl Reactivator along with their moisturizing shampoo and their 3-in-1 Conditioners ! My hair is typically just a messy wave, no real style to it - but once I added their Curl Reactivator, it did exactly THAT! My curls were brought back to life! And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them. The 3-in-1 Conditioner can also be used as a leave in conditioner to give your hair that extra BOOST of hydration! Overall, I'd say 5 stars for @bumbleandbumble products they so kindly gifted me!", "Can we say hello to these beautiful curls!!! Luna is obsessed after trying @bumbleandbumble curl reactivator that was gifted to me by bumble and bumble. I was very impressed with how shiny it left her hair. It also left her hair smelling fresh and not sticky like other curl activators do. Hands down the best curl reactivator I've tried. Loved it so much we just ordered some more products to try and can't wait for them to get here.", "Bumble and Bumble sent me this for testing purposes. I enjoyed it! It smells SO good, and definitely helped to reshape my curls on Day 2. It really smoothes, and isn't too thick or heavy. My only issue is the dimethicone in this makes it a LITTLE drying, but it wasn't bad.", "Bumble & bumble gifted me their curl activator spray and so far I'm enjoying the results. The formulation really helps to revive my curls and provide moisture. I also like using this when my hair is freshly washed. The fact that it contains uv filters and quickly hydrates my curls 3c/4a haut type. If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair. It hydrates my hair while keeping it tame and not puffy. I've been using this for years and is a staple for my hair stash. I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "BB Curl gifted me. I have curly/wavy hair. Sometimes curly sometimes wavy. This product is amazing for my hair and I'm sure for yours too. It leaves my curls without frizz looking healthy and moisturized. I love how easy to apply is and also the smell is amazing. I'm so happy to have found this amazing line of products. Definitely will need to try more from the brand.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble.

I am extremely in love with this new formulation of butters and oils used in this product! I had used the previous formulation as well and loved it, but this one helps reduce frizz and hold the moisture in my curls for at least 3-4 hours longer. I have wavy to curly hair (3A/3B) and this product worked great on my otherwise full and dry hair.

You can use it one first second or third day hair and it still makes it look like you just washed it. There is no crunchy feel and it also smells amazing! I have never used a product like this.

This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft. Works great on its own and when used with the shampoo and conditioner. They're both awesome too. A little goes a long way and hydrate my hair without greasy feel or look. Complimentary from Bumble and Bumble. 100% honest review though!", "I have curly/wavy hair and I received this product complimentary from Bumble and Bumble.

I love that it adds moisture, some volume, and helps reduce my frizz.

( Gifted by Bumble and Bumble but opinions are all my own. )", "This smells AMAZING! I'm a huge scent person, so for me that is a big win. (It is strong though so if you are not a fan or sensitive for this, definitely consider that) I have dark brown hair (level 2/3) highlighted to a very light blonde (level 8/9). So that on top of being naturally curly (3a/2c) my hair is always super dry. Because of this I try to not wash it more than 1-2 times per week.

My hair is naturally curly but after bleaching/dying and daily use of hot tools it lost it's natural curls. This leave-in seems to be giving me back some waves without the crunchy effect, it even helped curl my ends some which I haven't been able to get my hair to do naturally in a while.

Shampoo: It has a rich consistency, with a milky color. The shampoo lathers quite well, love the soft flowery scent to it. . . . 3-in-1 conditioner: I used this to detangle in shower. It has a soft flowery scent to it. And it indeed detangled my hair rather fast. My curls looked defined even when they were wet. I used little bit of conditioner to style my hair as well after for leave in. . . . Reactivator: The reactivator has a spray nozzle, and sprays a generous amount of product. I used it the second and the third curl hair day. And it totally refreshed my curls, Also my frizz was visibly less. It was extremely easy to use and fast. The nozzle sprays out a generous amount of product, so it's easier to fix your curls, leaving your curls looking healthy and soft without it being crunchy. I have never been so satisfied with a product up until now. I genuinely loved using all the products.my curls have never felt this soft, bouncy and hydrated. They are amazing and I just loved them all. The best part is All the products are free from parabens, phthalates, mineral oils, sulfate cleansers, which is so amazing.", "This product was gifted by Bumble and Bumble for testing purposes, and unfortunately it doesn't work for me. It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic! This does contain silicones towards the bottom of the ingredient list, so if you follow the curly girl method know that this isn't technically approved, but I would be comfortable using this if I was going to clarify soon.", "This curl activator smells delicious! Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl line and this product is already reviving my curls. My hair is so moisturized and SILKY, it's actually making it effortless for me to wear my hair curly.

Curl Reactivator complimentary from Bumble and Bumble along with the shampoo and conditioner. This is my first time using products from Bumble and Bumble and I am loving it. Firstly, the fragrance of all these products are amazing. I love it when my hair smells good throughout the day. It makes me feel fresh too.

I will continue using these for sure!", "I used this product in combination with the whole Bumble & Bumble line including the shampoo and the conditioner. I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life. It's not complete magic so I still clearly need a haircut to cut off frizzy split ends but it worked on the rest of my hair to add shine and definition without weighing it down.

It hydrated my hair a ton, which is great since I have dry hair! Overall, I really recommend this product!", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me their Bb. Curl Reactivator in exchange for an honest review. My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair! My hair is super thick and it kept my curls looking beautiful and soft! It smells amazing and gave me hope in beautiful curly hair!

It also keeps the frizz away! I love this line so much! Highly recommend!", "I have thick naturally curly hair with a medium curl. Something was missing from my curl maintenance products. I always use Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream on my wet hair after washing and Davines Sea Salt Spray on my dry hair for a textured hold. To revive my curls on Day 2 and beyond I would rewet my hair and scrunch the curls. I needed a moisturizing styling mist to better reactivate my curls of Day 2 and beyond.

It could be love.", "my curls have never looked so beautiful! i have tried all kinds of products and i have always been disappointed with other products, whether they dried my hair out, didn't hold my curl , smelled too perfumey or weighed my hair down.

The shampoo helps to clean the scalp really well without leaving my hair dry. I used 2 pumps and it was quite enough to clean my scalp. Also it has a medium lather which I really like. The 3-in-1 conditioner can be used as a rinse, leave-in or co-wash. I used it as leave-in and only required 3-4 pumps which is quite less considering my long hair. It really helps to moisturize my hair and makes hair clump into small curl families easily. Coming to the curl reactivator, which I'm trying for the first time actually felt really good on hair. It helps to bring out the curls ,vanish the frizz and instantly makes the hair manageable. I used it on damp hair and it left my hair easy going the whole day.

Bumble & Bumble has been one of my go-to brands for years, so I was thrilled when they gifted me the new Bb. Curl Collection. The shampoo and conditioner smell amazing, as I expect from everything Bumble and Bumble. Now that fall is here and the furnace is on I noticed a big difference in both my skin and my hair, and these products helped my hair look and feel more moisturized. The star of the show, for me, is the Curl Reactivator. I use it as both a nourishing heat protectant before I blow dry my hair and as a way to keep my waves defined in between washes.

This will definitely be coming with me on the drive to Austin!", "@bumbleandbumble kindly gifted me some items from their NEW Bb Curl Line which all contain an oil butter blend of jojoba, avocado, coconut oils and cocoa, shea butters . Bb Curl Moisturizing Shampoo The texture thick and has a decent amount of lather but it didn't strip my hair. It is free of sulfates and color-safe. My hair detangle with no struggles . Bb Curl 3-in-1 Conditioner This was my favorite product. You can use it as a rinse-off, co-wash or leave-in. It's has great slip, works through your hair with no effort. It's super moisturizing as a co-wash alone and a potent leave-in . Bb Curl Reactivator This product is a moisturizing conditioner type mist used to reactivate and revive curls even on day 2, 3 or beyond. I find it too much if I used the leave-in. Makes day 2 curls like wash day but day 3 curls begin to get weighted down . I can see myself going through bottles of the 3-in-1.

And I absolutely LOVE that you can use it as a style refresher in between washed as well. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week so I can ALWAYS use duo products like this. As for the shampoo and conditioner, they made my hair so soft and has such a nice light scent to them.

If you're have tighter & dense curls , you'll likely enjoy this too.", "Bumble and Bumble gifted me today with their curl reactivator hair product in exchange for my honest thoughts. I tried it out along with their shampoo and conditioner today and LOVED it! Immediately after showering, i applied the reactivator spray and it was not only super easy because the spray made it super nicely applied and really even. my curl pattern was noticeably more defined, and when my hair dried out, it looked SO soft and voluminous! It was not crunchy at all and i really felt like my hair had never looked better!", "I love this whole line. If you have wavy or curly hair I feel like you would love these products. They make my hair shiny, smooth and gives my curls volume without weighing them down. I don't feel like it strips my hair at all. In fact it's very rich and gives my curls some bounce and defines them. I pair them with the shampoo and conditioner.", "I love trying new products for curly hair, so I was excited when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their @bumbleandbumble Curl Reactivator. They even threw in their Moisturizing Shampoo and 3-in-1 Conditioner. The Curl Reactivator is a blend of avocado, coconut and jojoba oils and also shea and coco butters to deeply hydrate, reduce frizz and lightly hold. This works on day one, two , and three or beyond, to refresh and reactivate curls. I use this on freshly washed hair instead of curl creams or gems and it makes my hair super soft and really defines my curls. I use it on day 2 hair to refresh them and it does so without weighing them down. I love the shampoo! It really hydrates my dry hair. The conditioner can be used as a co wash, a conditioner or a leave in conditioner. My favorite way to use it is as a conditioner that I don't rinse out all the way. It makes my hair super soft! If you're a curly girl, you'll love this line! Thank you so much @bumbleandbumble for defining my curls!", "My curls can get quite unruly after a good night's sleep even with the use of a silk bonnet (yes, I know!) and silk pillowcase. So when #bumbleandbumblegiftedme their Bb. Curl Reactivator, I had to try it immediately! Well, the results are incredible! My curls were left more defined, soft and pretty! I tank you and my curls thank you! My life has been made easier", "Product #giftedbybumbleandbumble I have curly hair that have suffered from harsh chemicals in haircare products, causing them to become dry and brittle. I am always on the look out for products that would give my hair a natural shine And moisture. I have almost finished this bottle and it adds an extra layer of moisture, my hair feels soft, manageable and I can see the moisture coming back gradually.", "I received this product complimentary from bumble and bumble.This product is supposed to revive, reenergize and moisturize your curls (let me just tell you.. it does). I use this everyday in between my washes which is like 6 days and it works EVERY TIME. You wet your hair down, spritz generously all over and then scrunch you're hair up to leave it soft and curly again. It doesn't leave any crunch and works on your curls like nothing else does! This is easily my holy grail product for my day 2-6 hair. I love how soft and curly it leaves my hair and works every time. I would highly recommend this if you have curly hair and want to use something in between washes to keep that curl strong! I also revived the moisturizing shampoo complimentary from bumble and bumble. This is supposed to smooth your curls and leave you with no frizz. I was beyond blown away when I tried this for the first time. It is the most creamy, hydrating shampoo I have ever used (I mean ever). It is made with out sulfates so it doesn't strip my hair and actually is so creamy that I can detangle my hair with it in, which is not a normal thing to do with shampoo lol (and yes I've tried other sulfate free shampoos and none of them work like this). When my hair dries and until it gets greasy which is like day 6, my roots are SO SOFT! I can easily, without a doubt say this is my new favorite shampoo. If you have curly hair you need to get this RIGHT NOW and your curls will love you. The last product I was gifted from bumble and bumble is their 3-in-1 conditioner. This product can be used as a rinse out, leave in of co-wash (washing your scalp with conditioner). This conditioner works like a miracle. It detangles my hair SO FAST and leaves it so hydrated and soft. I apply twice, once to rinse out and second to leave in. When my hair dries, my curls are so defined and super soft with no frizz (usually my hair gets tangled and frizzy). This is my absolute new favorite conditioner. You need this in yo", "I love this product for my frizzy wavy hair. It hydrates my hair while keeping it tame and not puffy. I've been using this for years and is a staple for my hair stash. I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble.", "I received this product complimentary from Bumble and bumble. As a curly haired girl that experiences tangles and frizziness, this product definitely calmed it down! I'm typically not a fan of \"reactivating\" sprays because they typically don't do much for me. However, I noticed a definite difference when using this on day 2-3 hair! This tamed my frizz down, but still maintained the bounciness and shine of my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the slight smell, but it goes away after about 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, 5/5 starts! Definitely would recommend!", "BB Curl gifted me. I have curly/wavy hair. Sometimes curly sometimes wavy. This product is amazing for my hair and I'm sure for yours too. It leaves my curls without frizz looking healthy and moisturized. I love how easy to apply is and also the smell is amazing. I'm so happy to have found this amazing line of products.

I am extremely in love with this new formulation of butters and oils used in this product! I had used the previous formulation as well and loved it, but this one helps reduce frizz and hold the moisture in my curls for at least 3-4 hours longer. I have wavy to curly hair (3A/3B) and this product worked great on my otherwise full and dry hair.

So kind.", "My hair texture can vary day to day but my favorite products remain the same. Bumble and bumble gifted me their curl reactivator and I am loving how easy it is to refresh my hair. You can use it one first second or third day hair and it still makes it look like you just washed it. There is no crunchy feel and it also smells amazing! I have never used a product like this.

This is the most hydrating curl reactivator I have tried in a looking time. I used it as a leave in conditioner first, before combing my hair and it left my hair so soft and knot free. It smells amazing and it gave my waves nice definition without weighting them down. The next day I re applied on dry hair and it worked wonders again. I was afraid it was going to leave my hair sticky if I used too much but nope, this stuff is like water. My hair soaks it up and it is left moisturized, shiny and soft. Works great on its own and when used with the shampoo and conditioner. They're both awesome too. A little goes a long way and hydrate my hair without greasy feel or look.

It made my second day 2B/2C waves stringy and frizzy. My hair is very high porosity, so I wonder if that was a factor in how my 'do responded to this spray. On the positive side, it didn't leave my hair feeling sticky or coated and it smells fantastic!

I have naturally wavy hair with tighter curls at the bottom that had lost their definition due to dryness and frizz. This curl reactivator system was able to hydrate and bring my curls back to life.

My hair is wavy (2B) on the top half and curlier (3A) underneath on the bottom half. It's also fine so it's weighed down very easily and my curls tend to become a wilted mess overnight. This definitely does the job of re-activating them the next morning so that I only need a few strategic curling iron waves added to revive the style. It's super hydrating which leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft but also weighs it down easily so I'm really only able to get 1 extra day out of it. I also like to use it on clean hair as a moisturizing detangled to define curls and act as a UV Protective leave-in treatment prior to styling. This would be the perfect product for anyone with 3B or tighter curls without a doubt!", "This product was far more than I ever thought it would be! It worked great on both wet and dry hair!
